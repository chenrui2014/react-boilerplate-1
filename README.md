# React Boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate with a bunch of features including linting for Sass/SCSS and ECMAScript with AirBnB's rules, Webpack Bundling and Minification, Jest Testing, PWA service worker generating, Offline packages with Yarn, and a Node server with Express for hosting.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the Repo.
1. Navigate to the repo directory and install packages with `yarn`.
1. Start the development server with `yarn start`

## Initial Machine Setup
1. **Install [Node 6.x.x or greater](https://nodejs.org)**
1. **Install Yarn with `npm i -g yarn`**
1. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 
1. **[Disable safe write in your editor](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#working-with-editors-ides-supporting-safe-write)** to assure hot reloading works properly.
1. On a Mac? You're all set. If you're on Linux or Windows, complete the steps for your OS below.  

**On Linux:**  

 * Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).    
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p` 

**On Windows:** 

* **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
* **Install C++ Compiler**. Browser-sync requires a C++ compiler on Windows. [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler. Or, if you already have Visual Studio installed: Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).

## To Do
- [ ] Upgrade `why-did-you-update` to remove setter and resolve [this issue](https://github.com/garbles/why-did-you-update/issues/45).
- [ ] Add [prepack-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/gajus/prepack-webpack-plugin) when available for Webpack 3.x.

# React Boilerplate

This is a React boilerplate with a bunch of features including linting for Sass/SCSS and ECMAScript with AirBnB's rules, Webpack Bundling and Minification, Jest Testing, PWA service worker generating, Offline packages with Yarn, and a Node server with Express for hosting.

## Quick Start
